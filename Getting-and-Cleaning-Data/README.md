This file describes how run_analysis.R script works:

- First, unzip the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip to your working directory.

- Then rename the working directory in the "run_analysis.R script" to your working directory. For example:
	setwd('C:/Documents and Settings/User/Dropbox/Coursera/Getting and Cleaning Data/Assignment/UCI HAR Dataset');

- After renaming the working directory, run the "run_analysis.R" script with R or RStudio.

- Finally, you will find a "tidyDataSet2.txt" file in your working directory with the required data.
