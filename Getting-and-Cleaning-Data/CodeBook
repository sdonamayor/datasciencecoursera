run_analysis.R script performs the following steps:

1. Sets the working directory.

2. Reads data from files:
	- features.txt
	- activity_labels.txt
	- x_train.txt (from directory 'train')
	- y_train.txt (from directory 'train')
	- subject_train.txt (from directory 'train')

3. Assigns column names to the imported data from above.

4. Merges the training data: xTrain, yTrain, subjectTrain

5. Reads data from the files in the test directory:
	- x_test.txt
	- y_test.txt
	- subject_test.txt

6. Assigns column names to the test data from above.

7. Merges the test data: xTest, yTest,subjectTest

8. Merges the training and test data to create a final data set (finalData).
	
9. Creates the variable "ColNames" with the column names from the final data set.

10. Selects the columns we need to extract the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (id_mean_sd). 

11. Set those selected columns as the final data set.

12. Merges the final data set with the activity table to include descriptive activity names.

13. Updates the "ColNames" vector with the changes.

14. Cleans the variable names and labels them with descriptive activity names with a loop. 

15. Reassigns the new descriptive column names to the finalData set.

16. Create a new table ith the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (DataSet2).

17. Includes the mean of each variable for each activity and each subject (tidyDataSet2).

18. Merges the tidyDataSet2 with activity to add descriptive activity names.

19. Exports the tidyDataSet2 set as a text file.
